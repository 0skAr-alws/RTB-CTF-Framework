## To-do
 
- [ ] Add basic info and stuff to `layout.html`
- [ ] Need to implement `home.html`
- [ ] User is able to submit hash multiple times and keep increasing score, so need to implement limitations
- [ ] make better UI for `machine.html` 
- [ ] Need to implement `account.html` (not a priority)
<hr/>

- [x] Login/logout/registration works fine.
